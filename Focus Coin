FOCUS Coin was created by former developers of Zcash and Bitcoin until a new set of developers, DevTeamSix set in to kick off and achieve the goals of the company. They are a fully doxxed team who has shown their faces and business address. This is a multibillionaire team of highly experienced developers, entrepreneurs, and marketers with decades of experience. They launched FOCUS coin since 2019 and achieved a hard cap of 100,000,000 FOC. The market cap kissed $300M in 2019 and is now increasing to $650M. This may be the last chance to get in and invest on FOCUS coin.

WHY DO I NEED TO INVEST IN FOCUS COIN?

Let‚Äôs face it; most projects being shilled here are posted by people who have already bought in early looking to dump. The crypto market has been underwhelming lately, and many projects have gone to the grave. FOCUS coin is one of the few projects still holding strong since 2019 and the team behind it (DevTeamSix)  has launched a new whitepaper to guide and direct the investors on FOCUS coin plans 2021 and beyond.

FOCUS coin is the worlds first ever crypto with an adjusting feature and potential to speed up in price and cover a market cap of $650M in one month. This is achieved through the exchange and swapping of liquid (failed) coins to FOCUS coin.
